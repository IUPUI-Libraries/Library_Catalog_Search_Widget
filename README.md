Library Catalog Search Widget
=============================

An HTML, CSS, jQuery based widget for a Learning Management System (LMS) or web site that allows a user to search the library catalog and link to various library services. A working version of the code can be viewed at: http://mu.edu/library/lor/catalogwidget/

Special thanks to Jeff Carleson at Sacramento City College whose library search widget was the inspiration for this project. Learn more @ http://scc.losrios.edu/~library/tools/widget/
